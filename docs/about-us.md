# About Helpful Analytics

## Hi, I'm Brooks

I'm a solopreneur who's been building businesses for over 17 years. I run everything from local newsletters to content sites, manage a YouTube channel, and juggle about 18 different projects at any given time. It's chaos, but it's the good kind.

## The Problem That Was Eating My Time

Here's the thing: When you're managing 18+ properties with their own Google Analytics accounts, you don't have time to click through each one individually. But that's exactly what I was doing.

Every Monday morning, I'd log into GA4 for my newsletter. Then my blog. Then my YouTube Analytics. Then my other sites. Rinse and repeat. I'd spend hours just trying to figure out what was working and what wasn't across all my properties.

Honestly? I was spending more time trying to understand Google Analytics than actually using the insights. The GA4 dashboard felt like it required a PhD to navigate. I'd click around trying to read Google Analytics data, but I still couldn't answer simple questions like "What's working?" and "What should I do next?"

And here's the kicker: I couldn't abandon Google Analytics. Years of historical data, established tracking, client expectations—it was all there. I just needed a way to see everything in one place without losing my mind.

## Then I Realized: Marketing Agencies Have It Even Worse

If managing 18 properties was driving me crazy, I couldn't imagine what marketing agencies managing 20+ client accounts were going through. 

Client calls where you're frantically pulling reports. Team members duplicating work because they can't see what others have already analyzed. Hours spent each week just trying to explain Google Analytics metrics and data to clients who don't speak "analytics."

And don't even get me started on the difference between Universal Analytics and Google Analytics 4. That migration alone created chaos for agencies everywhere.

That's when Helpful Analytics clicked for me.

## So I Built Something That Actually Works

I needed a single dashboard for Google Analytics where I could see all my GA4 properties at once. Not just the data, but what it actually *meant* and what I should do about it.

Basically, I needed a Google Analytics alternative that didn't require me to abandon years of historical data. Something that worked *with* GA4, not against it.

So I added AI to do the heavy lifting. Now, instead of spending hours analyzing data across multiple properties, I get clear, actionable insights:
- "Your client's blog traffic is up 35%—the content strategy is working"
- "This property's bounce rate spiked yesterday—might be a technical issue"
- "Here are the top 3 pages driving conversions this month"

It's like having a data analyst on your team who speaks in plain English and monitors all your clients 24/7.

## Built by Someone Who Gets It

I use Helpful Analytics every single day to manage my own 18+ properties. If it works for me juggling multiple businesses, it'll definitely work for your agency managing client accounts or your company tracking multiple brands.

Here's what makes it different: I'm not some big analytics company trying to upsell you on features you don't need. I built this because I had the exact problem you have right now.

I'm not some big analytics company trying to sell you a bloated enterprise solution. I'm just a guy in Mobile, Alabama, who wanted to make sense of his Google Analytics data without pulling his hair out.
